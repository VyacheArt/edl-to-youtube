# Timecode Generator from EDL

## Description

This is a simple tool to generate a timecode sequence from an EDL file. It is written in Go (yes) and uses
the [fyne](https://fyne.io/) toolkit for the GUI.

## YouTube

All the process is shown in 3 videos on YouTube (russian):

- [1. Conception](https://youtu.be/5DIYb3bJ4Bo)
- [2. Development and issues with fyne](https://youtu.be/ks8fT3UHVfE)
- [3. Publication](https://youtu.be/D_4ge_YEakU)

And the whole project I called like "Not Perfect Project" because it's not perfect, but it works.
